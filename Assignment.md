# Multithreading Assignment-1

## Theoretical Questions:
1. What is multithreading?
1. What is the difference between thread and process?
1. When to use and when to not use thread in the system?
1. In what kind of scenario a single threading system   will perform well as compared to multithreading?
1. What is an orphan/jombie thread/process?
1. What is the critical section?


## Coding Problems:
1. Can you please write a code to create a thread using c++??
1. Write two functions(one to calculate multiplication and another one to calculate division of two numbers), and call them using two different threads? Make sure both the threads join the main thread once the task is completed.
1. Can you write a program to get the output from a function that is called using std::thread? If yes, please do. (Hint: Try passing one variable using reference)
1. Can you please write a program to prove:
    * Single threaded system works faster than a multithreaded system..(In certain cases, you will figure this out out if you have watched the lectures)
    * Multithreaded system works faster than a single threaded system.(In certain cases, you will figure this out out if you have watched the lectures)

1. Can you think of some critical section problem and write a program to show the inconsistency in the output(Donâ€™t use the example shown in the series)?

## What is the right way to attempting these problems:
* Follow all the lectures just before this assignment, most probably you should be able to solve all the problems once you go through the series.
* For good understanding around theoretical questions, just google search, you should be able to find good blogs around them.
* Once you solve all the problems, just upload them on github and share the link with me, I will be super happy to provide you the feedback.
